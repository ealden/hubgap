# HubGap: Unofficial BlackBerry Client for GitHub

This is mostly an experiment on [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com), [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com), [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com) and [BlackBerry](http://blackberry.com) development.  I have a BlackBerry Bold 9780 and have been using the Social Feeds application to read through my GitHub RSS, and I figured it would be great to have a BlackBerry client for GitHub.
